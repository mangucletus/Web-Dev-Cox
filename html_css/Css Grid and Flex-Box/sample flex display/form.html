        The above form enlists the credential of the applicant Make sure the information provided is very <strong>correct</strong>and well spelt Misrepresentation of information will lead to dismissal and sanctioning As far as the admission to IIMs are
        concerned, the documents are only verified on the day of registration to the program. If your work ex score bracket will change after rectifying the details and if as a result you ideally weren't supposed to make it to the merit list, they will
        postpone your admission after giving you the wait list number provided they have given the buffer calls and you make it to wait list. Now if your WL number gets cleared, you will get the admission or else your admission will be canceled.
        <br>Incase of private colleges like MDI, IMT, IMI etc your documents will be verified on the day of interview so you can provide the correct details there with reasonable explanation. Thank you

            <br>the severest form of which is dismissal or being handed over to be tried in the law courts of Ghana if such conduct is found in breach of the laws of Ghana or both. <br>The reputation and integrity of<strong>KNUST</strong>among institutions
            of higher learning and as a national asset is of utmost important to alumni, management faculty and staff. <br>Therefore, students should not seek refuge under national law to escape internal enquiry, when they have not fully exhausted all
            internal avenues of redress <br>provided the issues under consideration are not life.
